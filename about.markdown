I am a market research professional and find enjoyment in making sense of data and finding insights in plethora of information.

When I am not working I enjoy watching movies of varied genre and languages. I also love reading and my interest varies from  Harry Potter
to Martian, to Selfish Gene.

Lately I have become interested in data visualization and information design.
Understanding how human mind perceives and interprets information really fascinates me. 

I shall be using this space mainly for writing about my journey in data visualisation and occasionally about anything that intrigues
 me.
